# AWC Toolshed
Collection of web-based tools for AniList's [Anime Watching Club](https://anilist.co/forum/thread/4449)

Over the years of actively participating in the community i've created various things that made things easier when it comes to planning out challenges.
These tools include...
- [BetterList](https://koopz.rocks/betterlist/) - A table of an AniList user's anime which provides additional filtering features not provided by AniList itself
- [BetterBrowse](https://koopz.rocks/betterlist/better-browse.html) - The same as above but for the entire AniList database, basically competing against [AniList's Browse function](https://anilist.co/search/anime)
- [BetterCharacters](https://koopz.rocks/betterlist/better-characters.html) - Still very expiremental derivate of BetterBrowse pointed at characters since [AniList devs started introducing fields for them](https://anilist.co/forum/thread/3878/comment/811888). At the point of writing this the API doesn't have any way to query those yet. Another derivate is yet to be created for staff members
- [Challenge Updater](https://koopz.rocks/awc-updater/) - A little tool that updates a participant's challenge code and replaces title and date placeholders with data from the AL API
- [Interactive Jigsaw Helper](https://koopz.rocks/betterlist/jigsaw-interactive.html) - Another tool that heavily helps sorting out the [Jigsaw Puzzle Challenge](https://anilist.co/forum/thread/11405) because doing it manually is a massive pita
- [Challenge Editor](https://koopz.rocks/monaco) - Really just Monaco with AWC specific syntax highlighting.

The longterm goal of this project is to actually unify all of this ugly mess :clown_face: into a single website for more convenience.
I'll also use this repo's Issue tracker for whatever feedback i get from my current userbase.
